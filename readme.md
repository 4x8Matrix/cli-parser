# CLI Parser

I needed a cool CLI parser for Luau that handles global options, options, commands, subcommands, arguments - so fourth.

I may end up making documentation in the future, depends on how useful this package is - @ me in the ROSS discord if you are interested in this package and would like to see documentation.
